*	Rule base shouldn’t be too time consuming. We shouldn’t spend too much time implementing this. 
*	SSN sends back dummy data. We shouldn’t be focused on implementing correct SSN handling.
*	Asynchronous vs synchronous (SOAP-services). Pros and cons?
*	Error handling - If the whole process (or a component) stops: how do we handle it? How long does the end user wait? Error message?
*	Testability is a good thing to discuss. Mocking/Unit testing? Refer to the EIP book if necessary. 
*	The RabbitMQ channel used can be the supplied one. We are allowed to create our own.
